# DatabaseSearch
School Project to Parse information from a Small database

This is the final project for Systems and Low-Level Programming (CIS-2107) at Temple University.

We were given a small text-file database with information about a small group of students and their 
ability to access certain resources at the College. We were asked to read a person's input from 
STDIN and determine the resources that are available to that particular ID, and output the ID and 
the available resources to the "person_resource" file.

Much of the Program was already written for us. Everything in 'db_helper.h' was written previously and remain unchanged, 'db_helper.c' was already there but I made modifications to the getValue method and commented out most of the printf calls except the ones that were useful. 

Everything in 'main.c' above and including the main method was written by me.
