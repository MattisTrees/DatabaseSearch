# DatabaseSearch
School Project to Parse information from a Small database

This is the final project for Systems and Low-Level Programming (CIS-2107) at Temple University.

We were given a small text-file database with information about a small group of students and their 
ability to access certain resources at the College. We were asked to read a person's input from 
STDIN and determine the resources that are available to that particular ID, and output the ID and 
the available resources to the "person_resource" file.
